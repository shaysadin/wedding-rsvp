One of the most frustrating parts of wedding planning is chasing down RSVPs. You've set a deadline, but responses trickle in slowly - or not at all. Here are proven strategies to maximize your response rate.

## Set a Strategic Deadline

Your RSVP deadline matters more than you think:

- **4-6 weeks before the wedding** is the sweet spot
- Too early, and guests procrastinate thinking they have time
- Too late, and you won't have time to finalize with vendors

## Make Responding Easy

The easier you make it to RSVP, the more responses you'll get:

### Use Digital RSVPs

Paper response cards require guests to find a pen, fill it out, and mail it back. Digital RSVPs let guests respond in seconds from their phone.

### One-Click Response

With Go Approval, guests receive a personalized link that takes them directly to their RSVP page. One tap to confirm, another to decline. No forms, no friction.

### Mobile-Friendly

Most people check messages on their phones. Make sure your RSVP experience works perfectly on mobile devices.

## Send Strategic Reminders

Not everyone responds immediately - and that's okay. Plan for reminder messages:

1. **First reminder**: 2 weeks before deadline
2. **Second reminder**: 1 week before deadline
3. **Final reminder**: 2-3 days before deadline

Keep reminders friendly and light. Something like: "We can't wait to celebrate with you! Just a gentle reminder to let us know if you can make it."

## Follow Up Personally

For close family and friends who haven't responded, a personal phone call or message goes a long way. Sometimes people just need a little nudge.

## Common Reasons People Don't RSVP

Understanding why helps you address the issue:

- **They forgot** - Reminders help
- **They're unsure about attending** - Make it easy to decline gracefully
- **They lost the invitation** - Digital invitations can be resent
- **They think they already responded** - Confirmation messages prevent confusion
- **Life got busy** - Multiple reminder channels (WhatsApp, SMS) help reach them

## The Power of WhatsApp

WhatsApp messages have a 98% open rate compared to just 20% for email. When you send invitations and reminders via WhatsApp:

- Messages arrive instantly
- Guests see them during their daily messaging
- Responding is natural and quick
- You can see delivery and read receipts

## Track Everything in Real-Time

Stop wondering who has responded. With a proper RSVP management system, you can:

- See responses as they come in
- Know exactly who hasn't responded
- Filter by response status
- Export reports for your venue

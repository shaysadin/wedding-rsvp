Managing a wedding guest list is one of the most challenging aspects of wedding planning. Between family politics, budget constraints, and venue capacity, it's easy to feel overwhelmed. Here's how to stay organized and stress-free.

## Start with Categories

Organizing your guests into categories makes everything easier:

- **Immediate family** - Parents, siblings, grandparents
- **Extended family** - Aunts, uncles, cousins
- **Bride's friends** - Close friends and acquaintances
- **Groom's friends** - Close friends and acquaintances
- **Work colleagues** - Current and former colleagues
- **Plus ones** - Partners of invited guests

## The A/B List Strategy

Not sure who to invite? Create two lists:

**A List**: Must-invite guests who you absolutely want there
**B List**: Guests you'd love to have if space and budget allow

Send A-list invitations first, then invite B-list guests as declines come in. This approach helps you maximize attendance without over-inviting.

## Track Essential Information

For each guest, keep track of:

1. Full name and contact details
2. Mailing/physical address (for formal invites if sending)
3. Phone number (for WhatsApp/SMS)
4. RSVP status
5. Dietary restrictions
6. Table assignment
7. Which side (bride/groom)

## Common Guest List Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Not Setting Clear Plus-One Rules

Decide early whether single guests can bring a date. Be consistent with your policy to avoid hurt feelings.

### 2. Forgetting to Account for Children

Are kids invited? Make this clear in your invitation to avoid confusion.

### 3. Inviting Out of Obligation

Your wedding should be filled with people who matter to you. It's okay to keep the list tight.

### 4. Waiting Too Long for RSVPs

Set a clear RSVP deadline and send reminders. Most venues need final counts weeks in advance.
